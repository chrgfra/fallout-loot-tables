    <p>A specialized model of plasma gun developed by the Enclave. It has more precise and sophisticated construction than a run-of-the-mill plasma gun, giving it more damage potential but also it's more difficult to modify. Visibly, an Enclave plasma gun is distinguished by its darker color scheme. Any attempt to modify an Enclave plasma gun has +2 complication range. Mods for an Enclave plasma gun are incompatible with a standard plasma gun and vice versa, and all Enclave plasma gun mods are Rare.</p>
